design-patterns
===============
This repository helps explain the design patterns by showing their real life examples.
The idea is that design patterns when expressed with real examples are easier to understand and appreciate.

I have decided to code these patterns into various languages to show that the design pattern can be expressed independently of language features (mostly true).

If you need any more info or have comments please send me an email at sayganesha@gmail.com with "design_pattern_repo" in the subject.
